# Evocation Sunburst
It's like Evocation Sunburst but a game instead of a game engine. (so yknow, you can actually play it.) 

**The Sound is really loud at the moment. Probably best to turn down your volume!**

# How to Run
Go to the Releases Tab in this github repository. Download the .jar file and double click to run it.
Please note that you need Java 17 SE installed to run this game.
